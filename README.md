# Postza: A free Postman

I am hoping to add features as need grows.
Don't hesitate to add an issue if you want a feature or have any issues at all. I will gladly try to fix them.

## Reasons for making:

1. I found Postman to be too much of a hassle.
2. Saw a video on YouTube of someone trying to make a postman alternative.
3. Wanted to try out SvelteKit and have some practice on making websites.

## Making

Made with [[https://kit.svelte.dev/][SvelteKit]] and [[https://tailwindcss.com/][TailwindCSS]].
I enjoyed the whole process and am looking forward to creating more projects with these, especially Svelte.


Below is the general SvelteKit README.

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
